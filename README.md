# 🚨 AI Security Intelligence  
**Automatic AI-based real-time threat detection & alert system for national security**

## 🔥 Overview  
AI Security Intelligence is a real-time mobile-based threat detection and alert system designed for public safety and emergency response. It detects threats, analyzes behavior, and sends alerts with location details.

## ✨ Key Features  
- 🔍 Real-time AI Threat Detection  
- 📡 GPS Location Tracking  
- 🚨 Automatic Emergency Alerts  
- 🎤 Voice-based SOS Activation  
- 📱 Mobile App (Thunkable)  
- 🔐 Privacy-focused system  

## 🧠 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow  
- Thunkable (Mobile)  
- GPS & Mobile Sensors  

## 🚦 How It Works  
1. App captures surroundings using mobile sensors  
2. AI model analyses activity  
3. Danger score is generated  
4. If danger detected → Automatic alert  
5. Location + threat info sent to emergency contact/authority  

## 🏗 System Architecture  
Sensors → AI Model → Risk Score → Alert Engine → Emergency Notification  

## 🌍 Use Cases  
- Women’s safety
